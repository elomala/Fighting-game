<h1 align="center">FIGHTING GAME</h1>
This is a <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/2166055981/Fighting-game">project</a> I started working on in 2023. This is one of my very first projects in which I knew what I was doing.<br>
I made multiple projects a while back but none of them were completed. <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/2166055981/Fighting-game">This game</a> is also, not complete but it is playable.
<br>This game has a <a href="https://trello.com/b/XfQLXXVA/fighting-game">trello</a> which describes the abilities of the classes. You can also access the info ingame.
<h2>Fighting System</h2>
There are multiple functionalities in the game which are described below:<br>
<ul>
    <li><b>Basic Stats:</b></li>
    <ul> 
      <li><b>Health:</b> Amount of Damage a player can take before dying</li>
      <li><b>Stamina:</b> Some functions like jumping and dashing require stamina. Stamina regeneration depends on health to prevent players from running easily.</li>
      <li><b>Walkspeed:</b> Every class has a different walkpeed depending on its playstyle. Classes with high health usually have low walkspeed and vice versa.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><b>Attacking:</b></li>
  A specific class has an auto combo, a guardbreak and four special attacks. Details can be seen on the trello page.
</ul>
